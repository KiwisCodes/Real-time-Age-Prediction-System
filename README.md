# Real-time-Age-Prediction-System

This project focuses on age estimation using deep learning techniques. It includes a comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art methods and a unified benchmark.

## Project Structure

- `A Call to Reflect on Evaluation Practices for Age Estimation-Comparative Analysis of the State-of-the-Art and a Unified Benchmark.pdf`: A research paper providing a comparative analysis of age estimation methods.
- `best_model.pth`: The best performing model's weights.
- `Complete_Code.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the complete code for the project.
- `cropped_faces_2.zip`: Dataset of cropped face images used for training and evaluation.
- `Deep_Residual_Learning_For_Image_Regconition.pdf`: A research paper on deep residual learning for image recognition.
- `LiveDemoCode.py`: Python script for running a live demo of the age estimation model.
- `pretrained_resnet50.pth`: Pretrained ResNet-50 model weights.
- `README.md`: This file.
